                I did my PhD working on the philosophy of science (history of analytic philosophy, logic, foundations of probability theory, foundations of biology), and I have a minor in Computer Science.<br /><br/>However, I've been programming since I was a teenager, and I've done everything from technical writing, to writing tools for doing analytics, to data engineering, to UI/UX design, to working on backend systems, and to working on a developer experience team. I'm now employeed as a Business Intelligence Developer. Oh, and I also write science fiction and enjoy oil painting.

                I still enjoy thinking and reading about the history and foundations of science (especially the history of cybernetics and the social sciences).
