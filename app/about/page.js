                I also spend time making video games, using Godot and Unreal Engine 5.<br/><br/>I'm currently working on a C++ module for Godot using the EnTT entity component system for 4x Strategy games. Most of my time is spend working with Godot in C++ and GDScript, especially UI/UX design and game mechanics.

                I did my PhD working on the philosophy of science, and I have a minor in Computer Science.<br />I've been programming since I was a teenager, and I've done everything from technical writing, to writing tools for teams, to data engineering, to UI/UX design, and to working on a developer experience team.<br />I'm now employeed as a Business Intelligence Developer. But I also do other things. For example, I write science fiction and spend time painting with oils and drawing with charcoal.

                I still enjoy thinking and reading about the history and foundations of science (especially the history of cybernetics and the social sciences).<br/> I still use my expertise in (evolutionary) game theory and Bayesian statistics for designing game mechanics.
