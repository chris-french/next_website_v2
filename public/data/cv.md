## Dissertation Summary

The dissertation examines Rudolf Carnap's efforts to apply scientific principles to philosophy, treating his philosophical work as a form of conceptual engineering. It focuses on how Carnap created and utilized inductive logics to clarify and organize the foundations of statistical inference and decision theory. The work contributes to the re-evaluation of Carnap's philosophy, especially in understanding why he frequently referenced his work on artificial languages in philosophical disputes, rather than engaging directly with natural language discussions on truth and analyticity. By examining historical case studies in design engineering, the dissertation argues that Carnap's work on inductive logic was akin to engineering activity, aimed at developing practical, though not necessarily correct, logical frameworks to elucidate the conceptual underpinnings of mathematics and empirical sciences.

The dissertation details Carnap's analogy between pure and applied logic to the distinction in geometry, addressing problems in current interpretations of Carnap's logic of science. It employs a hierarchical concept of engineering design to reinterpret Carnap's work on inductive logic, suggesting Carnap's goal was not to find a correct but a "good enough" inductive logic. Additionally, it explores how Carnap developed various inductive logics based on the concept of degree of confirmation, aiming to find optimal statistical estimation functions without favoring any specific method or incurring metaphysical commitments. Finally, it examines how Carnap applied his theoretical work to practical sciences, illustrating a transition from empirical to rational decision theory, and then to inductive logic, highlighting his approach as a nuanced and comprehensive form of conceptual engineering in the logic of science.
